# duml-beagle-parse

Simplistic usage example of [duml-packet](https://github.com/strazzere/duml-packet). This will parse an exported csv of data from [Beagle Usb](https://www.totalphase.com/protocols/usb/) products and strip out RX/TX packets that contain duml. It will decorate and combine them for easier analysis later.
